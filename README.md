# ARW FILE REMOVED
This Python script removes ARW files that don't have a corresponding JPG file with same name inside the same folder.

For example, if you have file1.jpg and file1.arw and file2.arw in a folder, the script will remove the file2.arw file.

**It will create a folder named "_removed" and move all the files there.**

**After that, you can safely remove the files yourself.**

It can be also used for removing other types of files (you will have to change the file extension inside the code).
