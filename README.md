# ARW FILE REMOVED
This Python script removes ARW files that don't have a corresponding JPG file with same name.

**It will create a folder named "_removed" and move all the files there.

After that, you can safely remove the files yourself.
**
It can be also used for removing other types of files (you will have to change the file extension inside the code).
